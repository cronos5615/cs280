Securing the Future of AI Through Rigorous Safety, Resilience, and Zero-Trust Design Principles
As foundational AI models grow in power and reach, they also expose new attack surfaces, vulnerabilities, and ethical risks. 
This white paper by the Secure Systems Research Center (SSRC) at the Technology Innovation Institute (TII) outlines 
a comprehensive framework to ensure security, resilience, and safety in large-scale AI models. By applying Zero-Trust principles, 
the framework addresses threats across training, deployment, inference, and post-deployment monitoring. 
It also considers geopolitical risks, model misuse, and data poisoning, offering strategies such as secure 
compute environments, verifiable datasets, continuous validation, and runtime assurance. The paper proposes a roadmap
for governments, enterprises, and developers to collaboratively build trustworthy AI systems for critical 
applications.
