Kids are using the Internet at a younger age and spending more time online, according to UNICEF. 
One in three Internet users worldwide is younger than 18, it reports. An increasing amount of harmful online 
practices and content is impacting children mentally, emotionally, and physically, 
as well as posing a risk to their safety and security.

This has led many governments and regulatory agencies around the world to introduce legislation to reduce addictive
 online features and to take steps to restrict youngsters' access through various means, including by mandating that
  online sites use systems to verify a user's age. These systems can give parents peace of mind, knowing the website
   has taken measures to deactivate addictive algorithmic mechanisms and to present content geared for children and
    is safe for them to use.

To help developers build age-appropriate websites, the IEEE Standards Association has released two guidelines: 
one for the process of designing age-appropriate sites for children and the other for systems to verify the user's 
age online. IEEE SA also launched a related certification program.
