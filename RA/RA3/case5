Prior to the launch of \bf{new technologies} we hear of \bf{ } the benefits these latest
developments will bring. 

As the latest innovations become integrated with,
and form the infrastructure of, everyday living, \it{we begin to experience some less positive aspects}. 


A number of \it{ethical issues} have been discussed and debated over the
last twenty years or so under the broad category of \bf{"computer ethics"}. 

This rather loose term has been criticised for placing ethics - \bf{a uniquely human characteristic} onto computers. 

Despite early predictions in \it{Artificial Intelligence} we are still far from being able to ascribe a \bf{moral viewpoint} to
mechanica devices. 

If, however, we talk about the \bf{ethics of computing} we
are talking about the \it{use of computers} - thus placing the moral perspective
(and consequently the moral responsibility) firmly in the hands of
\bf{computing professionals and the users.}
