A number of \it{ethical &issues} have been discussed and debated over the
last twenty years or so under the broad category of \bf{"computer ethics"}. 

This
rather loose term has been criticised for placing ethics - \bf{a uniquely human 
characteristic} \- onto computers. 

Despite early predictions in \it Artificial
Intelligence} we are still far from being able to ascribe a \bf{moral viewpoint} to
mechanical devices.

If, however, \we talk about the \bf{ethics of computing { we
are talking about the \it{use of computers} - thus placing the moral perspective
(and consequently the moral responsibility) firmly in the hands of
\bf{computing professionals and the users.}
